            technology. In particular, photography marked a transition from interpreting culture through painting and prints, to capturing it through a realistic lens that replicated real life. As a result, Ukiyo-e prints began to be used less as a way
            to portray realism, and more as a form of art and advertisement. The photograph, along with the new and unfamiliar presence of the West, marked a shift in Japan’s exterior image. The subjects that Japanese photographers chose were the same
            as those of the native arts of the late feudal period: famous places, women and actors. However their presentation was influenced by tourism (NY Times). Japanese photographers saw opportunity in selling images of traditional aesthetics and
            customs that were commonplace to the Japanese, but that appealed to fresh foreign eyes. This gave birth to the tourist photograph; a platform to present a stereotyped view of Japanese culture, or how it was perceived to be. Ukiyo-e prints
            were exoticised as well, as European collectors took delight in the “exotic” world they suggested (<strong>Merritt, 125)</strong>. As seen through early photography, Japanese culture was romanticized to pander to the Western gaze. This curated
            Japan’s impression upon the outside world, portraying it as a traditional nation impervious to modernity rather than one rapidly developing in industrialization. “Romanticizing Japan: Contextualizing Japan Through the Western Gaze” explores
            the modes in which Japan was displayed -- either realistically or idealised -- for a local and global audience.</p>
